<h2>About Discoverly</h2>
<p>Your guide to discovering authentic local experiences beyond the tourist trail</p>
</div>

<div class="content-section">
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We created Discoverly because we believe travel should be about more than just checking off famous landmarks. The best memories come from stumbling upon a cozy café tucked in a medieval cellar, discovering a Sunday flea market filled with local treasures, or joining an impromptu dance class at a neighborhood venue.</p>
<p>But finding these authentic experiences shouldn't require hours of scrolling through TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook groups. That's why we built a platform that brings all the best local spots and events together in one place.</p>
